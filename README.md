## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This time I use custom properties from the begining and it actually improves the way I write the CSS, it felt more fluid and easy to achieve the design

### Continued development

I will focus on using more custom properties and pure css tools to understand what is going on behind the css frameworks.
